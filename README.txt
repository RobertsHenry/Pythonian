The StudentDiningClass.py takes the JMU dining system and implements it into a console version where students can measure remaining values they have for eaching form of currency at JMU. A student can use it to easily track how many punches, dining dollars, and much flex they have left; as well as tracking depositing into those accounts. It requires dated entered by the user themselves, but allows them to figure out the information without having to go through the mess of mymadison to access the information.
